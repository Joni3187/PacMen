Description:
PacMen exercise, where we create a game that places Pacmen images on the screen and when activated move and bounce around the screen!


How to run:
Factory for making pacmen:
When button "make one" is pressed a pacman will appear randomly on the screen. 
to position the new pacman image and add it to the "game" div. It is then added to the array of pacmen, which keeps track of the position and velocity of each pacman.
when button "start game" is pressed the pacmen on the screen will begin to move around the screen!

Roadmap:
Future Developments:
assorted colored pacmen,
new image for "ghost" characters,
pacmen music playing in background!
